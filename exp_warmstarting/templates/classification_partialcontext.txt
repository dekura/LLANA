You are assisting me with automated machine learning using [MODEL] for a [TASK] task. The [TASK] performance is measured using [METRIC].
The dataset has [NUM_SAMPLES] samples with [NUM_FEATURES] total features, of which [NUM_NUM_FEATURES] are numerical and [NUM_CAT_FEATURES] are categorical.
[ADD_CLASS_INFO]
I’m exploring a subset of hyperparameters detailed as: [CONFIGURATION_AND_TYPE].
Please suggest [NUM_RECOMMENDATION] diverse yet effective configurations to initiate a Bayesian Optimization process for hyperparameter tuning.
You mustn't include ‘None’ in the configurations.
Your response should include only a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary describes one recommended configuration. Do not enumerate the dictionaries.
